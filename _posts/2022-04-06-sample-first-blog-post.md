I was deep in slumber last night when all of a sudden Joe called me. I was like huh? Why is this old raising hitting me up at 2 AM?

I picked up. 

JB: "Hey Jill ... Jill. Jill I lost my dentures where are they?"

Me: "Goddammit Joe. We already did this once. I'm not Jill alright, you know this!"

JB: "Oh stop playing with me Jill. It's way too late for this. Please, grow up"

Me: "Hey, I'm a big boy now. You can't just mess around with me and expect to get away with it!"

JB: "I love when you get aggressive, Jill ;) Gets partner down there fired up to at least 20 degrees if you know what I mean."

Me: "You are disgusting Joe. Don't call this number again, or I will literally nuke the entire east coast."

JB: "aghh ... zzzz .... aghhh .... zzzz"

Me: "Did you fall asleep Joe? Seriously! Sigh. Well, till next Monday I suppose."
